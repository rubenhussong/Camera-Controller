# Three Orbit X Controller

Custom and modular Three JS Camera Controller.

## Features

- Works in object space
- Smooth dampening
- Toggle between different modes:
  - 'orbit' allows control like OrbitControls.
  - 'isotropic' allows control like TrackballControls.
  - 'grounded' allows control like on a planet. The orbit center is fixed, panning is actually a slow rotation around the center, and the view direction is detached from the orbit center.
